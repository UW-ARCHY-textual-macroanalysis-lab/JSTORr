\title{Plot the frequencies of one word against another word over time in a JSTOR DfR dataset}
\usage{
JSTOR_2words(unpack1grams, word1, word2, span = 0.4, se = FALSE,
  yearfrom = NULL, yearto = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{unpack1grams}{object returned by the function JSTOR_unpack1grams.}

\item{word1}{One word (or vector of words), surrounded by standard quote marks.}

\item{word2}{One word (or vector of words), surrounded by standard quote marks.}

\item{span}{span of the lowess line (controls the degree of smoothing). Default is 0.4}

\item{se}{display standard error of lowess line. Default is no (false).}

\item{yearfrom}{year to start the x-axis from, the minimum year to display on the plot}

\item{yearto}{year to end the x-axis at, the maximum year to display on the plot}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot object with publication year on the horizontal axis and log relative frequency on the vertical axis. Each point represents a single document.
}
\description{
Function to plot changes in the relative frequency of two words (two 1-grams) over time. The relative frequency is the frequency of the word in a document divided by the total number of words in a document. For use with JSTOR's Data for Research datasets (http://dfr.jstor.org/).

\examples{
## JSTOR_2words(unpack1grams, "diamonds", "pearls")
## JSTOR_2words(unpack1grams, word1 = "milk", word2 = "sugar", span = 0.8) +
## scale_y_continuous(trans=log2_trans()) # to diminish the effect of a few extreme values
