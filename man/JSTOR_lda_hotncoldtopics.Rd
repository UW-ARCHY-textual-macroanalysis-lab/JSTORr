\title{Plot the top five hot and cold topics in the archive}
\usage{
JSTOR_lda_hotncoldtopics(lda, pval = 0.05, ma = 5, size = 12)
}
\arguments{
\item{lda}{the object returned by the function JSTOR_lda.}

\item{pval}{p-value of the correlation cutoff for topics to include in the top 5 negative/positive list (ie. only topics where p<0.01 or 0.001?). Default is 0.05.}

\item{ma}{moving average interval, default is five years.}

\item{size}{size of the text in the legend (the topic keywords). Default is 12.}
}
\value{
Returns a plot of the hot topics and plot of the cold topics and a list of dataframes of the topic proportions per year. Years as rows, topics as columns and posterior probabilities as cell values. Uses a five year moving average to smooth the plots a bit.
}
\description{
Generates plots and data frames of the top five hot and cold topics. Hot topics are topics with a positive correlation to year of publication, cold topics have a negative correlation. For use with JSTOR's Data for Research datasets (http://dfr.jstor.org/).
