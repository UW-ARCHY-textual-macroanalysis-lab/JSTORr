\usage{
JSTOR_2bigrams(unpack2grams, bigram1, bigram2, span = 0.4)
}
\arguments{
\item{unpack2grams}{object returned by the function JSTOR_unpack2grams.}

\item{bigram1}{two words, surrounded by standard quote marks, or a vector of bigrams.}

\item{bigram2}{two words, surrounded by standard quote marks, or a vector of bigrams.}

\item{span}{span of the lowess line (controls the degree of smoothing). Default is 0.4}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot object with publication year on the horizontal axis and log relative frequency on the vertical axis. Each point represents a single document.
}
\description{
Function to plot changes in the relative frequency of two bigrams over time. The relative frequency is the frequency of the bigram in a document divided by the total number of bigrams in a document. For use with JSTOR's Data for Research datasets (http://dfr.jstor.org/).
