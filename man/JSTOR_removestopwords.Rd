\description{
This function removes stopwords from a corpus (it is a simple wrapper for tm::removeWords). Note that the function JSTOR_corpusofnouns contains this stopword removal function also, but it can be very slow due to the part-of-speech tagging. As a convenience, the stopword removal function is provided separately to enable quick repeats of the stopword removal process as the stopword list is updated and other functions are re-run.  This function uses the stopword list in the tm package. The location of tm's English stopwords list can be found by entering this at the R prompt: paste0(.libPaths()[1], "/tm/stopwords/english.dat")
