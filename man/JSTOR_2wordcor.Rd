\title{Plot the change over time of the correlation between one set of words and another set of words in a JSTOR DfR dataset}
\usage{
JSTOR_2wordcor(unpack1grams, word1, word2, span = 0.4, yearfrom = NULL,
  yearto = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{unpack1grams}{object returned by the function JSTOR_unpack1grams.}

\item{word1}{One word or a vector of words, each word surrounded by standard quote marks.}

\item{word2}{One word or a vector of words, each word surrounded by standard quote marks.}

\item{span}{span of the loess line (controls the degree of smoothing). Default is 0.4}

\item{yearfrom}{year to start the x-axis from, the minimum year to display on the plot}

\item{yearto}{year to end the x-axis at, the maximum year to display on the plot}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot object with publication year on the horizontal axis and Pearson's correlation on the vertical axis. Each point represents all the documents of a single year, point size is inversely proportional to p-value of the correlation.
}
\description{
Function to plot changes in the correlation of two set of words (two sets of 1-grams) over time. For use with JSTOR's Data for Research datasets (http://dfr.jstor.org/).
